# [Is Every Picture Worth 1,000 Words?](https://ia.net/topics/is-every-picture-worth-1000-words)

> The issue with saying “a picture is worth a thousand words” is it sets up a false battle between words and images...
> 
> Letting images and pictures compete for supremacy reduces the complex relationship between images and words into a direct, quantifiable comparison.

Ok, sold. I need to stop using that phrase. One is not better than the other. It’s not an either/or. They both have roles to play, strengths and weaknesses, and they reinforce each other.

> While images can instantly evoke feelings or set a scene, they lack the specificity and explanatory power that words can provide. While words can be precise and informative, they might not capture the immediacy or emotional resonance that a well-chosen image can deliver.

> Instead of pitching images and text against each other, we need to learn when to use which, and how to use both images and words to strengthen each other...
> 
> Images and words are different forms of language. One can express that which the other cannot.

To summarize:

Do your images add meaning? Or are they merely decorative?

Ironically, the phrase “an image is worth a thousand words” is conveyed via words and not an image.
