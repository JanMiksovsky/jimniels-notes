> As you can see, the sharing options depend on what the user has installed on their device. This is great because as the developer, you don’t have to care about what social networks they use—the list of options is always relevant.

Good example of not trying to assume everything yourself. Defer to your users’ preferences!

(Reminds me of Jeremy’s work around [a native `button[type=share]`](https://gist.github.com/adactio/092b11a74eded2701335ba27f94d2484)).
