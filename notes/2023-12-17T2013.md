I like this observation about the innate compassion induced by the form of blogging (especially in contrast with social media):

> In his early drafts [George Saunders] says he’s inclined to be initially sarcastic and throughout his editing process he tries to be more specific and less boring. George noticed for his writing this has a tendency towards love and compassion. I want to emulate that as much as possible…I can be sarcastic myself, so I try to be eager to give grace to anything I’m writing about. I am not perfect at this. It takes practice and iterations (rewriting!). The “slow” speed of making a blog post gives more space for this. And social medias have a strong tendency away from that compassion.
