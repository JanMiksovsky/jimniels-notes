# [We're not trying to build another Slack](https://app.campsite.co/campsite/p/notes/rk9py5ruzlri)

Brian Lovin talking about the shift from email et al. to Slack:

> But this shift came with a cost: as the friction to share fell, the quantity of shared things skyrocketed. As quantity skyrocketed, it became harder to find the signal in the noise. It gave us the tools to think out loud in front of hundreds of people, molding incomplete thoughts and ideas one push notification at a time.

Sounds like AI on the public internet. But I digress. Back to Slack:

> [Slack is] a tool that lets anyone distract everyone with each new message.

Damn this is on point.

> _Ah, look how much work I am getting done!_ you think to yourself as you bounce uncontrollably between a dozen threads and channels of varying importance.
