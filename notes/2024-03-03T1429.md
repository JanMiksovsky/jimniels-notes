# [A Kafkaesque digital relationship with ourselves](https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/blog/kafkaesque-digital-relationship-with-ourselves/)

Simone touching on the phenomenon of presenting ourselves as a product on our “personal” websites with phrases like, “I’m Jim Nielsen. A designer, developer, and writer with 20+ years experience on the web.” Boring! (I need to fix my home page.)

> defining myself through job roles, awards, or the fact that I might be a public speaker, is good for a resume. Anywhere else, it becomes deeply uninspiring and uninteresting. That is what I might be doing for a living right now, but it doesn’t represent who I am as a person with values, interests and priorities.

There’s utility here for sure, but there’s also a painful realization that you’re simply commoditizing yourself.

> I don’t “help companies” achieving something, I work for a salary doing things that, when luck strikes, I might even enjoy.
