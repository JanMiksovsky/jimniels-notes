> Knowing which [time management] trick you need now—and which one you’ll need next time—comes with experience and the kind of situational awareness that can be cultivated with (wait for iiiiit…) time.

Ha, pun intended!

> It turns out, not doing [what they enjoyed] was costing them time, was draining it away, little by little, like a slow but steady leak. They had assumed, wrongly, that there wasn’t enough time in the day to do [what they enjoyed], because they assumed (because we’re conditioned to assume) that every thing we do costs time. But that math doesn’t take energy into account, doesn’t grok that doing things that energize  you gives you time back.

I like this idea: by _spending time_ doing what you enjoy, you are sort-of earning more time — kind of like an investment I suppose. In other words, you don’t need to make time for what you enjoy, you need to do what you enjoy and that _makes_ more time.

How does spending time on something make more time? Doing what you need to, what you enjoy, can help give you the energy to do everything else you need to.
