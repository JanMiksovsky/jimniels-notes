> Some organizations see lines of code as a productivity metric, but I see them as a liability metric.

Also, lol, this great line from Dave is my new fav saying when it comes to doing just about anything in a codebase:

> I [could do it], but the juice would not be worth the squeeze

And I love this idea: if only computers made noise, so when you made them work better they got quieter and less annoying and people actually noticed.

> I think collecting metrics are a nice way to grease the wheels of your organization and show progress on work that is essentially invisible. If I do a great job, no one will notice but it will be less noisy or potentially faster. A part of me wishes computers made a physical noise (beside Slack notifications) whenever they were having a bad time, then it’d be more obvious to everyone when code needs fixing. You wouldn’t have to convince anyone to pay down some technical debt because everyone would be yelling “Can you please make that fucking computer stop squeaking?”
