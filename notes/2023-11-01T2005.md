# [Brian Lovin on Landing Page Design](https://x.com/joindiveclub/status/1719381055759954005?s=20)

Brian's take: we are in the flashy era of landing page design where aesthetics are deemed more important than substance.

> There is an obsession [right now] with “bento grids” where every box has a micro interaction. And it's insane because it gets likes on Twitter — so people keep doing it because it feels good to get likes on Twitter.
>
> Every landing page is over-invested in “What’s the micro-interaction, scroll-animation we can add here?” Instead of, “How do we explain what our product does really clearly?”

Nailed it.

In contrast, what’s Brian’s approach to his company's landing page design?

> There is a series of words that I want you to read as you scroll down the page. The visuals [are supportive] and yeah you might actually linger on those for a second. But I want you to leave the landing page knowing what our product does and whether it's useful for your team.
