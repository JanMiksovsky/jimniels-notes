# [Array Types in TypeScript](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/array-types-in-type-script)

Also enjoyed this point about how “it’s shorter” has never been a great argument for the use of one syntax over another:

> Fewer characters to write. As if keeping code short was ever a good indicator for maintainability.
