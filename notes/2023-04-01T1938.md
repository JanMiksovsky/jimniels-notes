Jacobo Prisco has [a piece in WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/why-the-floppy-disk-just-wont-die/) noting how some aircraft, including 747s, still rely on floppy disks for their software updates. 

> It is possible to upgrade from floppy disks to USB sticks, SD cards, or even wireless transfer, but doing so could cost thousands of dollars—and mean making a change to something that, while archaic, is known to work.

Clive Thompson, in his newsletter, leaves this commentary:

> “While archaic, is known to work.” That final clause highlights why these floppy-disk-equipped 747s are a terrific object lesson in the challenges of embracing “cool new tech” in domains where error is super freaking bad. Pilots love flying older jets because they are well-known quantities; any bug or quirk was found out years ago. Do you really wanna gamble that the new data-transfer system for your 747 replicates data precisely as the old floppies did? I mean, it probably will. But, y’know, a 747 weighs 455 tons at takeoff; marginal errors matter.
