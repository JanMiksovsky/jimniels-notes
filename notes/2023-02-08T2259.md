Paul Ford on leadership:

> I used to feel that to demonstrate leadership I had to know everything. I had to show that I knew everything top to bottom.
> 
> [what is actually the case is] you don’t know everything. You’re just the guy in charge. So drive forward and let everybody tell you what you’re missing. 

Also, Paul on the traditional enmity between disciplines like engineering and marketing:

> The most brutal fact of life is that the discipline you love and care for is utterly irrelevant without the other disciplines that you tend to despise.
