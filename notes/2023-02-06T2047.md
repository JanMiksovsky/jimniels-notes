# [The Case of the Bing Ban Theory](https://daverupert.com/2023/02/solved-the-case-of-the-bing-ban-theory/)

> When in doubt, blog it out

A great catchphrase! Blog your problems, because one of the following will happen:

> 1. You’ll solve your problem while writing out your problem (Best)
> 2. Someone responds who knows how to solve your problem (Great)
> 3. No one responds and you learn you have a unique problem (Less great, but novel)

Also, this line casting SEO as analogous to mysticism is everything I love about Dave’s writing:

> “Use this tag” or “Don’t do this weird combination of HTML” SEO-tricks probably have an impact, but advice hits me like “Be sure to arrange the energy crystals on your homepage in a certain way.”
