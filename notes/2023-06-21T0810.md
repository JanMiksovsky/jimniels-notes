Christian Selig on his Apollo debacle:

Per my post about [knowing when to quit](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/art-of-knowing-when-to-quit/), I respect that disposition.

> I'm really sorry to those designers who didn't get to see their work launched in the app (to be clear, don't worry, I paid them all â€“ there isn't some bs "exposure" agreement

Christian was a model for how to do icon design in an app and pay creators for it.
