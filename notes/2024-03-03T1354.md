# [Exists is the enemy of good](https://seancoates.com/blogs/exists-is-the-enemy-of-good)

> We need to be very careful about justifying bad experiences with "perfect is the enemy of good" when we should be striving harder for good itself. The popularity of this expression is responsible for a lot of garbage. Sometimes we just shouldn't do the quick and easy thingâ€”even if we've tricked ourselves into thinking it's temporary. Exists is also the enemy of good.

Great counterpoint to the popular refrain. My experience resonates with this idea that people are often less willing to invest in a good solution when a mediocre one already exists.
