> When it comes to choosing what to do, it's always binary for me.
> 
> Yes or no.
> 
> Now or not now.
>
> Do or don’t.
>
> What about maybe? Maybe is no (for now).
>
> What about some grey area between now or later? Anything other than now rounds down to later.

> Being binary about what you choose to do brings clarity to what needs to be done.

“Maybe means no (for now)” is very relevant to me.
