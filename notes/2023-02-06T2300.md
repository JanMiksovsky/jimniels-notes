# [All Programming Philosophies Are About State](https://www.worldofbs.com/minimize-state/)

All programming philosophies can be boiled down to an opinion on how to deal with state. Examples:

> **Monolith** - Modifying state distributed among many services is hard to get correct; keep it centralized.
>
> **Service-Oriented-Architecture** - Modifying all of the state in one service is hard to get correct; distribute it among multiple services.

Lol. But I do think thereâ€™s something here. Contrast manifests trade-offs and that the silver bullet is a myth.

> Every programming philosophy is about how to manage state, and each philosophy comes with trade-offs. What this means is that there is no "one true way" to deal with state, and that each programming philosophy is useful and important in the correct domain.
