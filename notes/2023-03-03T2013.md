# [Low-friction publishing workflow](https://jlongster.com/my-low-friction-publishing-workflow)

Some interesting thoughts on SSG vs SSR, especially given there could be [a pendulum swing away from build steps](https://deno.com/blog/you-dont-need-a-build-step) coming:

> This site is dynamic; it’s hosted on fly.io which makes it super easy to run a server. Requests are handled by a server which query the graph and dynamically render the content. Cloudflare caches the requests.
> 
> Why not use a static site generator? The mental model of a static site generator has always felt more complex to me. I just want to handle a request and do stuff. The nice thing is the complexity can grow to my needs; when I’ve used static site generators before, they always start simple but it always turns into a headache to do anything more than simple markdown routes.
> 
> SSG also impedes the frictionless publishing workflow. I can write this content and press Cmd+Shift+e and see it immediately on my site. That’s amazing.
> 
> There’s no compile step to wait for. I just upload some new content and it’s immediately available.
>
> SSG favors run-time simplicity over build-time complexity. That’s a tradeoff many are willing to make, but I find having to commit my content and push to github just to publish content way too much friction.
