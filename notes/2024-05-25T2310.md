# [Generative AI Is Totally Shameless. I Want to Be It](https://www.wired.com/story/generative-ai-totally-shameless/)

> What I love, more than anything, is the quality that makes AI such a disaster: If it sees a space, it will fill it—with nonsense, with imagined fact, with links to fake websites. It possesses an absolute willingness to spout foolishness, balanced only by its carefree attitude toward plagiarism. AI is, very simply, a totally shameless technology.

It’s a shame how shamelessness is increasingly rewarded in the world — pun intended.
