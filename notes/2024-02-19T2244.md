# [File over app](https://stephango.com/file-over-app)

> File over app is a philosophy: if you want to create digital artifacts that last, they must be files you can control, in formats that are easy to retrieve and read. Use tools that give you this freedom.

> the files you create are more important than the tools you use to create them. Apps are ephemeral, but your files have a chance to last.

The web equivalent is: the websites you create — their content and functionally for end users — are more important than the tools you use to create them.

What your site is built and served with is ephemeral, but the content is what has a chance to last.
