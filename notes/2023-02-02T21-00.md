# [One morning in the future](https://adactio.com/journal/19851)

> I had video call this morning with someone who was in India. The call went great, except for a few moments when the video stalled.
>
> “Sorry about that”, said the person I was talking to. “It’s the monkeys. They like messing with the cable.”

At first I thought this was some reference to chaos engineering and [the chaos monkey](https://netflix.github.io/chaosmonkey/), but nope. Turns out this was real monkeys. 

> There’s something charming about an intercontinental internet-enabled meeting being slightly disrupted by some fellow primates being unruly.
