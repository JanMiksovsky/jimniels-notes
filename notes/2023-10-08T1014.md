Everything about this article is so good.

One of my fav repeating jokes was how “Grug tempted reach for club when too much ___ happen but always stay calm.”

A few of my fav excerpts.

> given choice between complexity or one on one against t-rex, grug take t-rex: at least grug see t-rex

> sad but true: learn "yes" then learn blame other grugs when fail, ideal career advice

> danger, however, is agile shaman! many, many shiney rock lost to agile shaman! 

> whenever agile project fail, agile shaman say "you didn't do agile right!" grug note this awfully convenient for agile shaman, ask more shiney rock better agile train young grugs on agile, danger!

> grug warn closures like salt, type systems and generics: small amount go long way, but easy spoil things too much use give heart attack

> is maybe nature of programming for most grug to feel impostor and be ok with is best: nobody imposter if everybody imposter
