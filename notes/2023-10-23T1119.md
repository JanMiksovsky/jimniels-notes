# [“The Making of the Atomic Bomb” by Richard Rhodes](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-making-of-the-atomic-bomb-richard-rhodes/7061381)

Albert Einstein admired Niels Bohr for:

> uttering his opinions like one perpetually groping and never like one who [believed himself to be] in the possession of definite truth. 

Basically the opposite of opinions on the internet.

Also this (from the book):

> Original work is inherently rebellious.
