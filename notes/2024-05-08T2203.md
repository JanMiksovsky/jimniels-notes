# [It's 2023, here is why your web design sucks.](https://heather-buchel.com/blog/2023/10/why-your-web-design-sucks/)

Include design earlier. Include engineering earlier. The split is the failure.

> I often feel like I'm ping ponging between these two scenarios:

> - "We would have designed this differently if we knew engineering couldn't handle it"
> 
> At what point do we stop and realize that we are setting our teams up for failure?

Also this on looking for a job:

> Am I going to find a place that will allow me to actually utilize all of this web design knowledge I have? Or, am I going to just be a JS engineer who spends most of my time configuring pipelines or doing ops work? I would say that most larger organizations favor the latter and live with the gaps in design.

That feels true to me. Orgs favor folks at the back-of-the-frontend and live with the gaps that result from that choice, hoping that when it comes to the front-of-the-frontend they’ll “figure it out as they go”.
