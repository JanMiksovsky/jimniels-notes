# [AI isn’t the app, it’s the UI](https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/05/01/ai-isnt-the-app-its-the-ui/)

> AI in its current state is very, very good at one thing: modeling and imitating a stochastic system. Stochastic refers to something that’s random in a way we can describe but not predict. Human language is moderately stochastic. When we speak or write, we’re not truly choosing words at random—there is a method to it, and sometimes we can finish each other’s sentences. But on the whole, it’s not possible to accurately predict what someone will say next.

It’ll be interesting to see how writers adapt to these models. For example, “finish each others words”. Word probabilities are based on patterns and rules, so what will make real human writing stand out from AI writing is breaking these long-standing rules off which AI is based.

In this light, we might be in for one of the greatest creative periods in history. Not because AI will help us do what we’ve always done just more efficiently, but because AI will force us to do new things differently, as that’s the only way we’ll stand out and be different.
