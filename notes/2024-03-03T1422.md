Here’s [Barry Hess](https://bjhess.com/posts/digital-relationships-offer-real-hope):

> I try to imagine what my life would look like if I was stuck with only the relationships geographically close to me. I have those relationships as well, and I treasure them, but they simply cannot offer the diversity of thought, background, and experience that digital relationships allow. I’m so incredibly thankful to live in an era where I can have the best of both worlds.

This was via Manuel’s post along with his commentary:

> The global nature of the web is an underappreciated quality. Like, can we just stop for a second and appreciate the fact that I’m typing this while sitting in Italy and you’re reading this somewhere else on the globe? It’s fucking amazing.

Amazing indeed. And I couldn’t agree more.
