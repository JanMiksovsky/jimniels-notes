> The act of spending that time in those [RSS] feeds still feels like a very deliberate, intentional act. Curating a set of feeds I find interesting and making the time to read them feels like an investment in myself.

I think there’s hidden value in the act of  curating your  own feed — plant new stuff and see if it takes root, pull out weeds, etc. — rather than offloading that work to some algorithm.
