# [From Yellow: Gall’s Law](https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2023/yellow-galls-law/)

Gall’s law:

> A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked.
>
> A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work.
>
> You have to start over with a working, simple system.

Baldur’s commentary:

> I always advocate [trying] to bake evolution into your design. It’s fine to have a complex system design that you’re aiming for in the long term, but you need to have a clear idea of how it will evolve from a simple system that works to a complex system that works
