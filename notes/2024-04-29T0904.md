# [webmentions make me sad](https://alexsirac.com/webmentions-make-me-sad/)

> Sometimes, all I want is to comment on someone’s post to say « lol » or « nice thanks for sharing » or « saaame! » and that’s not something that warrants a whole blog post and entry in my RSS feed.
> No, I don’t want to email you or send you a webmention to say « hehe this was funny ». Some things are funny, but not « share on my platform » funny...I feel a lack of connection on the indieweb and it sometimes makes me sad.

This is part of why I enjoyed Twitter — and it's a big part of what I still enjoy Mastodon. 

I want a place for fun, ephemeral conversation. Stuff that doesn’t merit a blog post. And I don’t want to manage, host, or archive that conversation. If it disappears tomorrow, that’s fine. I’ll find a new place for ephemeral conversation.
