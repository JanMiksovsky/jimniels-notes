# [Manage your priorities and energy](https://lethain.com/frameworks-decision-making/)

I kinda like this prioritization framework:

> 1. Generally, prioritize company and team priorities over my own
> 2. If I’m getting deenergized, artificially prioritize some energizing work. Increase the quantity until equilibrium is restored
> 3. If the long-term balance between energy and proper priorities can’t be balanced for more than a year, stop everything else and work on solving this (e.g. change your role or quit)

Also more blog posts like this please:

> I’ve come to appreciate that many of the folks I silently accused of malpractice were balancing context that I had no idea existed.

Also good advice (that’s also applicable to blogging):

> There’s no one solution, but you’re going to accomplish less in your career if you’re so focused on correctness that you lose track of keeping yourself energized.

And lastly, I like this open acknowledgement that sometimes you have to do the thing that’s not a top priority so that you can generate the energy to do the thing that is a top priority:

> It’s not only reasonable to violate perfectly correct priorities to energize yourself and your team, modestly violating priorities to energize your team in pursuit of a broader goal is an open leadership secret. Leadership is getting to the correct place quickly, it’s not necessarily about walking in the straightest line. Gleefully skipping down a haphazard path is often faster than purposeful trudging down the safest path.
