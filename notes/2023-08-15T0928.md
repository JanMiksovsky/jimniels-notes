# [Cuts on Creativity With John Mayer](https://twitter.com/bpoppenheimer/status/1688293445029302272?s=20)

On writing:

> When it comes down to writing…what connects with people is you connecting with yourself.

On writer’s block (this is blogging):

> Writer's block is not a failure to write. It's a failure to catch this feedback loop of enjoying what you're seeing and wanting to contribute more to it.

On failure:

> “That didn’t work” is ok to say. But “That won’t work” is not a way to go through life.

On finding yourself through copying and imitation:

> Failing to sound exactly like the person you want to sound like is a wonderful way to sound like yourself…I’m not thinking of this thing from scratch, “Ok I’m gonna do Jerry-esque things, but I'm still gonna sound like me.” No it’s more like, “I’m gonna sound _just_ like Jerry.” And then the way I naturally, obviously don’t, that’s your personality.
