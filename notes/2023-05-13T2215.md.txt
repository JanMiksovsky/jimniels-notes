# [Why I Blog](https://www.dannyguo.com/blog/why-i-blog)

Writing is thinking:

> If you had asked me when I was in school what the purpose of writing is, I would have said something like putting what you think into words. What I understand now is that the very act of writing can change your thinking. Writing is not mere transcription. It can be a way to think more clearly and to produce thoughts

Also this:

> When a topic or question comes up that I have written about, I love being able to just provide a link to my post instead of trying to recreate my past thoughts in a way that will inevitably be less coherent than my post. 

I don’t always feel like a successful, responsible adult. But when I do, it’s because someone asks what I think on a topic and I can respond with a link saying, “I wrote it down.”
