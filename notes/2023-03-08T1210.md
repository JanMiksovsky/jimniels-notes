> most product orgs suck and churn out garbage projects because they waste so much time thinking in terms of junk data and half baked user inputs to inform their decisions.

> (Show me what your org measures and I’ll show ya the crappy product that comes out the other side.)

Lol also this:

> NPS scores—the NFTs of product management—

When it comes to measuring:

> everyone in the field believing that they’ve built a science when they’ve really built a cult.

Honestly hard not to copy paste this whole article:

> This numerical value sure is bullshit but it’s not even helpful bullshit because these numbers never explain why things suck.
>
> (Just look at the product and it will tell you why it sucks.)

Boom! This phrase will stick in my head for years I think:

> the only way to build a great product is to use it every day, to stare at it, to hold it in your hands to feel its lumps. The data and customers will lie to you but the product never will.

I feel a lot like Robin:

> I don’t care what the data shows me and I’m not sure I ever will. You can show me charts and spreadsheets all day long and I will not care. Tell me what your gut says after relentless experience of the product every day. This is the only way to see the world clearly.

I just love this piece so much

> You can only build a great product if you care more for the vibes than for the data.
