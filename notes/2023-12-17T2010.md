# [Progressive Enhancement](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/discussion/progressive-enhancement)

The topic page on the Remix docs:

> Performance: While it's easy to think that only 5% of your users have slow connections, the reality is that 100% of your users have slow connections 5% of the time.
>
> Resilience: Everybody has JavaScript disabled until it's loaded.

How Remix works:

> Remix embraces progressive enhancement by building its abstraction on top of HTML. This means that you can build your app in a way that works without JavaScript, and then layer on JavaScript to enhance the experience.

What it means for you (and your users):

> It's not about building it two different ways–once for JavaScript and once without–it's about building it in iterations. Start with the simplest version of the feature and ship it; then iterate to an enhanced user experience.
