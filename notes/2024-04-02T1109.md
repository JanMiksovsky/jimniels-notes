> A computer is a general-purpose device that happens to run games. It’s that general-purpose-ness that expands what’s possible, and that’s something I value a lot.

Lot of good stuff in here about consoles vs. computers for gaming that can be generalized to interfacing with computers. 

Also loves this comparison: consoles are akin to walled gardens, computers are like the web. 

> Similar to smartphones, gaming consoles are polished, user-friendly, walled gardens that guide you down a pre-destined path. Gaming on computers are more like “the web.” Open. Expansive. Chaotic.
