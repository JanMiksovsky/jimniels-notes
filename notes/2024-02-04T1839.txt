# [AI Art is the New Stock Images](https://ia.net/topics/ai-art-is-the-new-stock-image)

> AI images make your audience think: “If they use cheap AI for images, they probably use it for the rest, too.” It raises questions about the authenticity of your content

Yeah, not gonna lie, I make these judgements.

> The question is: Do you always need an image? The use of images shouldn’t be an unconditional “always.” Instead, it should be a deliberate choice, driven by the specific needs and objectives of your content.

Don’t depend on images to do your job of writing.
