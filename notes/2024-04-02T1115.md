# [Margin considered harmful](https://mxstbr.com/thoughts/margin/)

Max on why we should ban margins at the component level:

> Margin conflicts with how designers think. Designers think about space in relation and context. They define how far a component should be from another component in a specific instance.
>
> By banning margin from all components you have to build more reusable and encapsulated components.

Makes sense to me. [It’s all about relationships between things.](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2021/designing-between-the-lines/) As Matisse said, “I don’t paint things. I paint the difference between things.”
