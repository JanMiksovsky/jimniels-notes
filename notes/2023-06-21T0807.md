# [73% of what?](https://world.hey.com/jason/73-of-what-80e24c13)

Lots of project management software will “take the true texture of a project” and flatten it “into a false linear representation of progress”. 

> a number can't represent the position of a project, or a piece of work. There's easier work, there's harder work, there's known work, there's unknown work.

> What does 62% done mean when the "remaining" 38% of the work is twice as hard as the initial 62%? 

> If you do the easy stuff first, and leave the hard, or unknown stuff to the end, 62% done isn't just misleading, it's malpractice.

We all love a good number we can use in our presentations, our reports, our promises to others — doesn’t matter how wrong it represents reality.
