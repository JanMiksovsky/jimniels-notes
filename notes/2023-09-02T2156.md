> And over the last 3-4 years, I've probably attempted a re-design [my personal site] no less than 10 times. I would start to design in Illustrator, I would then start building and then abandon it. My biggest hinderance was wanting my website to be tied to my personal identity. I would grow frustrated with it not fully embodying me and then decide I didn't need to re-design it and then cycle would start again.
