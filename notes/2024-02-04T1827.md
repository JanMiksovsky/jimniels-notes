A talk by James Long at dotJS 2019 around “local first” software. A few things that stood out to me:

- “Local apps” are fast because the computing takes place on your local device instead of a back and forth between client/server.
- “Local first” takes away all your performance concerns (that stem from having to use the network) because it simply takes away the network — and that's a whole swath of performance concerns.
- Because there’s no network, your app is only bound in performance by its computational (and memory) limitations.
- A whole swath of security concerns disappear if your app is local. As James notes, “You can’t SQL lite inject yourself.”
