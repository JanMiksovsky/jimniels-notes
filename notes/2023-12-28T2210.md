Via [Eric’s newsletter](https://buttondown.email/ericwbailey/archive/sc-244-marking-some-of-these-newsletters-as/):

> Does growing plants make me a better designer? Probably not, but that’s not why I do it. I do it because it brings me joy and because, in some abstract but deeply felt way, both activities tap into the same well of satisfaction and challenge.

The same could be said for working on your personal website, which reminds me of this quote from the article:

> Interacting with plants offers beauty, comfort, homecoming, and grounding. It may heal that which is broken. — DeJong, 2021, p. 25

Again: working on a personal website. It can heal what is broken.

But beware: it may also break what has been healed.
