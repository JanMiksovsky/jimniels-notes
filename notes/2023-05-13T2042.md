> At most companies, people put together a deck, reserve a room (physical or virtual), and call a meeting to pitch a new idea. If they're lucky, no one interrupts them while they're presenting. When it's over, people react. This is precisely the problem.

But the rest of the people in the room are asked to react. Not absorb, not think it over, not consider — just react. Knee-jerk it. That's no way to treat fragile, new ideas.

Well, when you put it that way, that does sound pretty crazy.

Me personally, I’m all for distilling your thinking through writing and allowing people the time and space for consideration — though all this “AI writes for me” seems sometimes the antithesis of that.
