# [Snake case is the best case](https://pedrocattori.dev/blog/snake-case-is-the-best-case)

In at article about snake case and why it’s “the fairest of them all”, Pedro starts his article practically:

> If you're working with code that already has a case style, just use that. An imperfect convention is better than two competing ones.

Acronyms are a particular pain case I encounter a lot.

> With other cases, you need to decide how acryonyms should be capitalized: `fetchRssFeedAsXml` or `fetchRSSFeedAsXML`? Should you always CAPS LOCK acryonyms? Or never do so?

`XMLHttpRequest` is a classic example of mixed casing baked right into the web platform: capitals are used both syntactically (breaks in words) and semantically (abbreviations).

This shook my world. I guess I’m team snake case now.
