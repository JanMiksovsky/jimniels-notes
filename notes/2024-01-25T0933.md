# [What Makes Software Resilient?](https://mailchi.mp/aboard/aboard-newsletter-tags-were-it-9618972)

Really loving Paul’s writing for _The Aboard Newsletter_ (I mean, he _is_ a professional writer).

> If you don’t know what product is being sold, you are the product. If you don’t know what business you are in, you are in advertising.

I’ve not heard the “you are in advertising” line before. That’s brilliant.

> So much today is focused on onboarding zillions of people and squeezing them like citrus. But more people, more problems. 

As an introvert, I agree: mo‘ people, mo’ problems.

> Software should be good for one person, good for two, good for ten, and then after that, it should take a hard look at itself.
