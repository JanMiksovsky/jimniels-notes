> by chasing trends we would never be the ones to set them.

If you do what everyone else is doing, how will you do what no one else has done?

> What’s really concerning is when everyone is consumed with the technology-first and the problem-last.

> I’m certain now that if you want to build something great you have to see through the tech.

I can tell you right now: I don’t follow a blog because of its design or tech stack. 

> if you want to build anything substantial, if you truly want to build a great product, then the technology has to come last.
