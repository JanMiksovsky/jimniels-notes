# [Onboarding roulette: deleting our employee accounts daily](https://graphite.dev/blog/onboarding-roulette)

> I’d strongly recommend other product teams consider automatically deleting employee accounts

Wait, what is this self-induced chaos? It’s wild, but…I kinda like it.

> Graphite aims for fast, bug-free, and painless onboarding. The best way for us to ensure this is to suffer through onboarding once every day ourselves. Across our full Eng-product-design team, any individual only gets deleted once a month on average. But one teammate a day hitting a sharp edge has proven enough to find and motivate fixing issues.

Reminds me of [Robin’s advice](https://notes.jim-nielsen.com/#2023-03-08T1210): to build a great product, you just have to use it. Over and over and over. There is no substitute.
